The app is a Dashboard utilizing random data set up in such a way to demonstrate the functionality of Streamlit and various charts utilized through pandas & plotly. Data can be filtered on the date of events and drilled down from there, as well as on State to track Status over time. The dates are limited to a weeks worth of data for the sake of simplicity for the app, though this could easily be expanded and scaled to however big the dataset is.
